# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rust Documentation Search MCP Server is a tool that generates and processes Rust documentation to make it more accessible to AI agents and developers. This server will use `cargo doc` to build documentation for Rust crates and implement fuzzy searching capabilities to extract relevant information in a format that is optimized for LLM consumption. By providing a more streamlined and focused view of Rust documentation, the server will help AI agents better understand and utilize Rust libraries when assisting with code development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Generation and Processing

**User Story:** As a developer using AI assistance for Rust development, I want the MCP server to generate and process Rust documentation in a format that is optimized for LLM consumption, so that AI agents can provide more accurate and helpful assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server initializes THEN the system SHALL use `cargo doc` to generate documentation for specified Rust crates.
2. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL process and transform the JSON format into a more LLM-readable structure.
3. WHEN processing documentation THEN the system SHALL extract essential information such as function signatures, parameter descriptions, and usage examples.
4. WHEN documentation contains complex nested structures THEN the system SHALL flatten and simplify them for better LLM comprehension.
5. WHEN documentation includes code examples THEN the system SHALL preserve them in a format that maintains their instructional value.
6. WHEN documentation is updated in the source crates THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to regenerate and reprocess the documentation.

### Requirement 2: Fuzzy Search Functionality

**User Story:** As an AI agent assisting with Rust development, I want to perform fuzzy searches on Rust documentation, so that I can find relevant information even with incomplete or imprecise queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search query is provided THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy matching algorithms (like `fzf` or similar) to find relevant documentation.
2. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL support partial term matching and handle typos gracefully.
3. WHEN multiple matches are found THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance score.
4. WHEN searching for functions or types THEN the system SHALL match against names, descriptions, and usage examples.
5. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include relevance scores or confidence metrics.
6. WHEN no direct matches are found THEN the system SHALL suggest related items based on semantic similarity.

### Requirement 3: Documentation Content Extraction

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to extract specific, targeted information from Rust documentation, so that I can provide concise and relevant assistance without overwhelming the user with unnecessary details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting documentation for a specific item THEN the system SHALL return only the relevant sections rather than the entire documentation.
2. WHEN extracting function documentation THEN the system SHALL include signature, parameters, return values, and examples in a structured format.
3. WHEN extracting type documentation THEN the system SHALL include fields, methods, trait implementations, and usage patterns.
4. WHEN documentation includes relationships to other items THEN the system SHALL provide this context in a concise manner.
5. WHEN documentation contains warnings or version-specific notes THEN the system SHALL highlight these important details.
6. WHEN extracting examples THEN the system SHALL provide context about what the example demonstrates.

### Requirement 4: Crate and Dependency Support

**User Story:** As a Rust developer using AI assistance, I want the documentation search to cover both the current project's crates and its dependencies, so that I can get comprehensive help with all the code I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing in a Rust project THEN the system SHALL detect and process documentation for the project's own crates.
2. WHEN a project has dependencies THEN the system SHALL generate and process documentation for those dependencies as well.
3. WHEN working with the standard library THEN the system SHALL include its documentation by default.
4. WHEN dependencies have different versions THEN the system SHALL maintain documentation specific to the versions being used.
5. WHEN new dependencies are added to the project THEN the system SHALL provide a way to update the documentation database.
6. WHEN documentation for a dependency is extensive THEN the system SHALL implement efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms.

### Requirement 5: MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want the Rust documentation search to integrate seamlessly with my IDE through MCP, so that AI agents can access documentation without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured THEN the system SHALL register its tools with the Kiro MCP system.
2. WHEN an AI agent invokes a Rust documentation search THEN the system SHALL handle the request according to the MCP protocol.
3. WHEN returning search results THEN the system SHALL format them according to MCP specifications for proper consumption by AI agents.
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages following MCP error handling guidelines.
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL validate its configuration and report any issues.
6. WHEN the server receives concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking.

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Performance

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to configure the documentation search behavior and ensure it performs efficiently, so that it enhances rather than hinders my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options in the mcp.json file.
2. WHEN configuring the server THEN the system SHALL allow specification of which crates to include in documentation generation.
3. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid unnecessary regeneration.
4. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL complete them within 2 seconds for typical queries.
5. WHEN the configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring a full restart.
6. WHEN the system uses significant disk space for documentation THEN the system SHALL provide options to manage storage usage.
